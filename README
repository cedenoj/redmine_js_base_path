Redmine JS Base Path Plugin
===========================

About
-----
This simple plugin provides a javascript variable - redmine_js_base_path - to aid in constructing url's in external javascript files where there is no access to the rails path helpers.  It consists of a single view partial that is rendered by the view_layouts_bas_html_head hook.
